# **Churnify - A Churn Prediction System**

## **Overview**
This project is a churn prediction system trained on a Kaggle dataset. It demonstrates the process of loading data, preprocessing, building, training, and evaluating a machine learning model to predict customer churn. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscription.

## **Kindly note**
Before running this project, make sure to download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and complete the necessary setup.

## **Project Highlights**

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Covers steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

- **Model Building:**  
  Utilizes a machine learning model to predict customer churn. The notebook explores different algorithms and selects the best-performing one.

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Evaluates the model using appropriate metrics and visualizations to understand its performance and make improvements if necessary.

- **Feature Importance:**  
  Analyzes the importance of various features in predicting churn, helping to understand key factors influencing customer behavior.
